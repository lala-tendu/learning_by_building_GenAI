# Today I Learned

---

Today I learned how **Semantic Search** works under the hood.

## Key Concepts

- **Embeddings**  
  Represent text as high-dimensional vectors.

- **Cosine Similarity**  
  Compares vectors by direction, not magnitude.

- **Vector Stores**  
  Efficiently store and retrieve embeddings.

## Why It Matters

Together, these components enable **meaning-aware search**, which forms the foundation of modern **AI search systems** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines.
